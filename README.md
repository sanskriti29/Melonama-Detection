# Melonama-Detection Assignment

The aim is to build a CNN model which can detect melonama.

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).
The data set contains the following diseases:
1. Actinic keratosis
2. Basal cell carcinoma
3. Dermatofibroma
4. Melanoma
5. Nevus
6. Pigmented benign keratosis
7. Seborrheic keratosis
8. Squamous cell carcinoma
9. Vascular lesion

    LIBRARIES IMPORTED :
pathlib
os
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
PIL
tensorflow
keras

  CONCLUSIONS :
Class with lowest number of images is seborrheic keratosis
Class with highest number of images is pigmented benign keratosis
Found 6741 files belonging to 9 classes.
Using 5393 files for training.
Overfitting issue is solved by class reimbalancing with training accuracy of 90% and validation accuracy of about 84%

Thank you upgrad team for the learning that helped in the project.
